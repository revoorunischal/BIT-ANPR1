The  aim  of  the  project  is  to  eliminate  the  manual  entry of   the  vehicle numbers and to design a more automatic way to identify the vehicle number through a camera in the phone. This is an android application which allows the traffic police to use the phone to recognize the number plate and send it to the database to check if any fines are registered against that vehicle and inform the traffic police and other traffic police in the surrounding places to catch the violator efficiently .It also allows the traffic police to register new fines against the vehicles committing new traffic violations
